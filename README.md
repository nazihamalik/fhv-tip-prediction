# Predicting the Tip for FHV Rides in NYC

In this big data project, I decided to test whether or not a passenger would leave a tip above 20% for their FHV rides based on multiple factors, such as the borough, time of request, month, and more. Through the utilization of Amazon Web Services and Databricks, I was able to build an ML Pipeline and develop a logistic regression model that predicts whether the tip is a "good" tip or not, with an AUC of 0.692 and an accuracy of 94.73%.
